# Thinkful Capstone: Flashcard-o-matic Application

Flashcard-o-matic is a Thinkful Frontend Development capstone project.
The starter HTML has been given, included with Bootstrap 4 styling.
I have been tasked with creating a flashcard study application, using the React JavaScript Library.
Teachers will use this app to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks.

# Technologies used
- React JavaScript Library

# Demonstrated the following
- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParam(), useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output using the VSC debugger

# Notes
- HTML and CSS files were given and did not need to be edited
- Frontend application was given and did not need to be edited
